2) Asked by Google
Given the sequence of keys visited by a postorder traversal of a binary search tree, reconstruct the tree.
For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, you should construct the following tree:

5
/ \
3 7
/ \ \
2 4 8

4) Asked by Airbnb : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places.
For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.
Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3, it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.
