2) Asked by Airbnb : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places.
For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.
Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3, it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.

3) Asked by Amazon

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.
For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. 
daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

10) LinkedIn: You are given a string consisting of the letters x and y, such as xyxxxyxyy. In addition, you have an operation called flip, which
 changes a single x to y or vice versa. Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all x's come before
  all y's. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return 2.

11) Asked by Salesforce
    Write a program to merge two binary trees. Each node in the new tree should hold a value equal to the sum of the values 
    of the corresponding nodes of the input trees. If only one input tree has a node in a given position, the corresponding node
    in the new tree should match that input node.

12) Given an unsorted array, in which all elements are distinct, find a "peak" element in O(log N) time.
    An element is considered a peak if it is greater than both its left and right neighbors. It is guaranteed that the first 
    and last elements are lower than all others.

13) Asked by Snapchat
    Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.
    IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers between 0 and 255. Zero-prefixed numbers, 
    such as 01 and 065, are not allowed, except for 0 itself. For example, given "2542540123", you should return 
    ['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123'].

14) Asked by Microsoft
    Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
    For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return [0, 7].
