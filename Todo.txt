2) Asked by Airbnb : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places.
For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.
Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3, it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.

3) Asked by Amazon

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.
For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. 
daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

4) Asked by Google
Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the number at index i, where distance 
is measured in array indices. For example, given [4, 1, 3, 5, 6] and index 0, you should return 3.If two distances to larger numbers
are the equal, then return any one of them. If the array at i doesn't have a nearest larger integer, then return null.
Follow-up: If you can preprocess the array, can you do this in constant time?
