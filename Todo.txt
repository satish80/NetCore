2) Asked by Airbnb : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places.
For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.
Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3, it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.

3) Asked by Amazon

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.
For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. 
daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.
